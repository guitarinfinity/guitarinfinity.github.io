1. What have I learned from the story of The Steadfast Tin Soldier at Pre-Uni class today? 
2. What’s the general principle?
3. What will I do differently in the future? 



1. Story? There 5 and 20 tin soidiers and some other toys.All of the toys are beatiful but the most beatiful toy is the ballet dancer.The tin soldier said to himself that would be just the wife for me’’he said. When it is evening the goblin told him to keep the tin soldier’s eyes to himself but he pretend he could not hear him.Very well then, wait to tomorrow said the goblin.the next morning the winds blew him out and kids saw him.Then it was raining so the kids made him a boat out of paper.Then he was sailing in the boat but then a water rat came and said where is your passport, give it to me at once’’said the water rat.But the tin soldier was just standing in the boat and said nothing at all so the water rat was chasing the tin soldier.then the boat was getting wetter and wetter and softer and softer until it sinks.A big fish swallowed the tin soldier but luckily it was caught. When the man chopped the fish he saw the tin soldier and he put it on the table.One of the children threw the tin soldier in the stove and got burned.                                                                                                                        



2. I learn that if you don’t obey you will get into big trouble. 

3. Obey your parents.
obey what parents tell you to do.
